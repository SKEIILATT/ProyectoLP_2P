## 1. TÉCNICAS DE ESTUDIO EFECTIVAS


### Study Skills
Study skillsorstudy strategiesare approaches applied tolearning. Study skills are an array of skills which tackle the process of organizing and taking in newinformation, retaining information, or dealing withassessments. They are discrete techniques that can be learned, usually in a short time, and applied to all or most fields of study. More broadly, any skill which boosts a person's ability to study, retain and recall information which assists in and passing exams can be termed a study skill, and this could includetime managementand motivational techniques.

Some examples aremnemonics, which aid the retention of lists of information; effective reading; concentration techniques;[1]and efficient note taking.[2]

Due to the generic nature of study skills, they must, therefore, be distinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study (e.g. music or technology), and from abilities inherent in the student, such as aspects of intelligence orpersonality. It is crucial in this, however, for students to gain initial insight into their habitual approaches to study, so they may better understand the dynamics and personal resistances to learning new techniques.[3]

Study skills are generally critical to success in school,[4]considered essential for acquiring good grades, and useful forlearning throughout one's life. While often left up to the student and their support network, study skills are increasingly taught at thehigh schoolanduniversitylevel.

The termstudy skillsis used for general approaches to learning, skills for specific courses of study.  There are many theoretical works on the subject, including a vast number of popular books and websites.  Manuals for students have been published since the 1940s.[5]

In the 1950s and 1960s, college instructors in the fields of psychology and the study of education used to research, theory, and experience with their own students in writing manuals.[6][7]Marvin Cohn based the advice for parents in his 1978 bookHelping Your Teen-Age Studenton his experience as a researcher and head of a university reading clinic that tutored teenagers and young adults.[8]In 1986, whenDr. Gary Gruber's Essential Guide to Test Taking for Kidswas first published, the author had written 22 books on taking standardized tests. A work in two volumes, one for upper elementary grades and the other for middle school, theGuidehas methods for taking tests and completing schoolwork.[9][10]

Memorization is the process of committing something to memory, often byrote.[11]The act of memorization is often a deliberate mental process undertaken in order to store information in one's memory for later recall. This information can be experiences, names, appointments, addresses, telephone numbers, lists, stories, poems, pictures, maps, diagrams, facts, music or other visual, auditory, or tactical information. Memorization may also refer to the process of storing particular data into the memory of a device. One of the most basic approaches to learning any information is simply to repeat it by rote. Typically this will include reading over notes or a textbook and re-writing notes.


### Teoría del Aprendizaje

### Gestión del Tiempo
Time managementis the process ofplanningand exercisingconsciouscontrol of time spent on specific activities—especially to increaseeffectiveness,efficiencyandproductivity.[1]

Time management involves demands relating towork,social life,family,hobbies, personal interests and commitments. Using time effectively gives people more choices in managing activities.[2]Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools and techniques, especially when accomplishing specific tasks, projects and goals complying with a due date.[3]

Differences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a linear time view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America and most Northern European countries, such as Germany, Switzerland and England.[4]People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time.[4]This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more "monochronic", or preferring to do only one thing at a time. As a result, this focus on efficiency often leads to a culture of punctuality and a strong emphasis on meeting deadlines.[5]

Another cultural time view is the multi-active time view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the better. This creates a sense of happiness.[4]Multi-active cultures are "polychronic" or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy.[4]In these cultures, people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations.[4]In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last and instead focus on having high-quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.[6]

A final cultural time view is a cyclical time view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence there is an unlimited amount of it.[4]This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia, including Japan and China. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to focus on completing tasks correctly, thus most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have, before acting on their plans.[6]Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage.[7]Consequently, this awareness often leads to a greater emphasis on relationships and the quality of interactions over strict adherence to schedules.[8]

Excessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result fromattention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD).[9]Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.[10]

Task lists are often prioritized in the following ways:

Various writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following.

## 2. FACTORES DE RETENCIÓN ESTUDIANTIL

### Student Retention
- Grade retentionorgrade repetitionis the process of a student repeating agradeafter failing the previous year.
- In theUnited States of America, grade retention can be used in kindergarten through to third grade; however, students in high school are usually only retained in the specific failed subject. For example, a student can be promoted in a math class but retained in an English class. Most elementary school grades (kindergarten through 5th grade) are taught all subjects in one classroom for the whole day, with exceptions in art and athletics. In these grades, the student who fails or scores below the accepted level in most or all subjects is to be considered for retention. If ultimately retained, the student will then repeat the entire school year's curriculum.
- Where it is permitted, grade retention is most common amongat-risk studentsin early elementary school.[1]At-risk students withintellectual disabilitiesare only intended to be retained when parents and school officials agree to do so. Children who are relatively young in their age cohort are four times more likely to be retained.[2]
- Mandatory grade retention of third-grade students who struggle in reading has been a critical part of theMississippi Miracle, which has seen several low-performing states soar in the national rankings as their students demonstrate increased confidence and capabilities in both reading and mathematics.
- Different schools have used different approaches throughout history. Grade retention or repetition was essentially meaningless in theone-room schoolhousesof more than a century ago due to limited access to outside standards and the small scale of the school with only a few students in each age group, was conducive to individualized instruction. With the proliferation of larger, graded schools in the middle of the nineteenth century, retention became a common practice and only one century ago, about half of all American students were retained at least once before the age of thirteen.[3]
- An alternative to grade retention due to failure is a policy ofsocial promotion, with the idea that staying within their same age group is important. Social promotion is the obligatory advancement of all students regardless of achievements and absences.[4]Social promotion is used more in countries which usetrackingto group students according to academic ability. Some academic scholars believe that underperformance must be addressed with intensiveremedialhelp, such assummer schoolorafter-schoolprograms in contrast to failing and retaining the student.[5]Social promotionbegan to spread in the 1930s with concerns about the psychosocial effects of retention.[3]Social promotion is the promoting ofunderperformingstudents under the ideological principle that staying with their same age peers is important to success. This trend reversed in the 1980s as concerns about slipping academic standards rose, and the practice of grade retention in the United States has been climbing steadily ever since.[6]However, in most other countries, retention rates have been decreasing.

### Academic Performance
- Academic achievementoracademic performanceis the extent to which astudent,teacherorinstitutionhas attained their short or long-term educational goals. Completion of educational benchmarks such as secondary school diplomas and bachelor's degrees represent academic achievement.
- Academic achievement is commonly measured throughexaminationsorcontinuous assessmentsbut there is no general agreement on how it is best evaluated or which aspects are most important—procedural knowledgesuch asskillsordeclarative knowledgesuch asfacts.[1]Furthermore, there are inconclusive results over which individual factors successfully predict academic performance, elements such as test anxiety, environment, motivation, and emotions require consideration when developing models of school achievement.[2]
- In California, the achievement of schools is measured by theAcademic Performance Index.[3][4]
- Individual differences in academic performance have been linked to differences inintelligenceandpersonality.[6]Students with higher mental ability as demonstrated byIQ testsand those who are higher inconscientiousness(linked to effort and achievement motivation) tend to achieve highly in academic settings. A recent meta-analysis suggested that mental curiosity (as measured bytypical intellectual engagement) has an important influence on academic achievement in addition to intelligence and conscientiousness.[6]
- Children's semi-structured home learning environment transitions into a more structured learning environment when children start first grade. Early academic achievement enhances later academic achievement.[7]

## 3. HABILIDADES DE AUTORREGULACIÓN Y METACOGNICIÓN

### Aprendizaje Autorregulado
Self-regulated learning(SRL)  is one of the domains of self-regulation, and is aligned most closely with educational aims.[1]Broadly speaking, it refers to learning that is guided bymetacognition(thinking about one's thinking),strategic action(planning, monitoring, and evaluating personal progress against a standard), andmotivation to learn.[2][3][4][5][6]A self-regulated learner "monitors, directs, and regulates actions toward goals of information acquisition, expanding expertise, and self-improvement”.[7]In particular, self-regulated learners are cognizant of their academic strengths and weaknesses, and they have a repertoire of strategies they appropriately apply to tackle the day-to-day challenges of academic tasks. These learners hold incremental beliefs about intelligence (as opposed to entity, or fixed views of intelligence) and attribute their successes or failures to factors (e.g., effort expended on a task, effective use of strategies) within their control.[8]

Finally, self-regulated learners take on challenging tasks, practice their learning, develop a deep understanding of subject matter, and exert effort towards academic success.[4]In part, these characteristics may help to explain why self-regulated learners usually exhibit a high sense ofself-efficacy.[9]In theeducational psychologyliterature, researchers have linked these characteristics to success in and beyond school.[10][11]

Self-regulated learners are successful because they control their learning environment.  They exert this control by directing and regulating their own actions toward their learning goals.  Self-regulated learning should be used in three different phases of learning. The first phase is during the initial learning, the second phase is when troubleshooting a problem encountered during learning and the third phase is when they are trying to teach others.[12]

Self-regulation is an important construct in student success within an environment that allows learner choice, such as online courses. Within the remained time of explanation, there will be different types of self-regulations such as the focus is the differences between first- and second-generation college students' ability to self-regulate their online learning. A comfort level of using the computer as a control provided evidence that first-generation students report significantly lower levels of self-regulation for online learning than their second-generation counterparts.[13]As to relating to Self-regulation, there are different strategies such as private writing techniques, which is a way as a form of text. It is a way of freewriting and journaling which are underexploited in academic writing instructions. However, it is only seen as a form of prewriting and is criticized for being under-theorized in the significance of writing a social practice that approaches drawing towards theconceptual frameworkof the conception of learning development.[14]It is estimated that students who are first-year students are discovering new strategies, This can be argued that the transition from secondary to tertiary education can be challenging for students, they must adapt to the independent nature of learning at universities. Learning strategies are rarely taught at universities, making it difficult for students to learn new strategies. The significance is evaluating small-group peer discussion boards as an avenue for sharing learning strategies between students in a first-year anatomy and physiology course.[15]It is believed that students perceive the outlining process, and students in business communication courses were surveyed about their perceptions of outlining. It is said that students were asked about how they outline, whether they outline, and why they outline. The significance was students were able to include organization within the outlining process and include content exploration which made it useful for students whose process included only organization or only content exploration.[16]Leading to the supposition that there is critical analysis in student writing such asfunctional linguisticsbeing presented. In a way where there were trainee teachers who were asked to write a form of descriptive writing to students attempting critical analysis. Although descriptive writing has an important role in learning for students. It is said that the discussion of critical analysis is realized in student writing.[17]Resulting in the importance of self-regulation in online learning, particularly with first-year and second-year college-generation students. First-generation students tend to report lower levels of self-regulation, in a way as a comfort level with using computers. Strategies such as private writing techniques and peer discussion boards can help students develop effective learning strategies, especially in the transition from secondary to tertiary education. Additionally, the outlining process and critical analysis in student writing are vital components of academic success. Overall, fostering self-regulation and providing support for diverse learning strategies are essential for students' success in online courses.

According to Winne and Hadwin, self-regulation unfolds over “four flexibly sequenced phases of recursive cognition.”[18]These phases are task perception, goal setting and planning, enacting, and adaptation.

Zimmerman suggested that self-regulated learning process has three stages:

Baba and Nitta (2015) demonstrated that Zimmerman's cyclical self-regulatory processes can be extended to longer periods of time and self-reflection has a close connection tosecond language writingdevelopment. From aComplex Dynamic Systems Theoryperspective, Wind andHarding(2020) found that attractor states might negatively affect the cyclicality of self-regulatory processes[clarification needed].[20]

### Metacognición
Metacognitionis an awareness of one's thought processes and anunderstandingof the patterns behind them. The term comes from the root wordmeta, meaning "beyond", or "on top of".[1]Metacognition can take many forms, such as reflecting on one's ways of thinking, and knowing when and how oneself and others use particular strategies forproblem-solving.[1][2]There are generally two components of metacognition: (1) cognitive conceptions and (2) a cognitive regulation system.[3][4]Research has shown that both components of metacognition play key roles in metaconceptual knowledge and learning.[5][6][4]Metamemory, defined as knowing about memory andmnemonicstrategies, is an important aspect of metacognition.[7]

Writings on metacognition date back at least as far as two works by the Greek philosopherAristotle(384–322 BC):On the Souland theParva Naturalia.[8]

This higher-level cognition was given the label metacognition by American developmental psychologistJohn H. Flavell(1976).[9]

The term metacognition literally means 'above cognition', and is used to indicate cognition about cognition, or more informally, thinking about thinking. Flavell defined metacognition as knowledge about cognition and control of cognition. For example, a person is engaging in metacognition if they notice that they are having more trouble learning A than B, or if it strikes them that they should double-check C before accepting it as fact. J. H. Flavell (1976, p. 232).Andreas Demetriou's theory (one of theneo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development) used the term hyper-cognition to refer to self-monitoring, self-representation, and self-regulation processes, which are regarded as integral components of the human mind.[10]Moreover, with his colleagues, he showed that these processes participate in generalintelligence, together with processing efficiency and reasoning, which have traditionally been considered to composefluid intelligence.[11][12]

Metacognition also involves thinking about one's own thinking process such as study skills, memory capabilities, and the ability to monitor learning.[citation needed]This concept needs to be explicitly taught along with content instruction.[13]A pithy statement from M.D. Gall et al. is often cited in this respect: "Learning how to learn cannot be left to students. It must be taught."[14]

Metacognition is a general term encompassing the study of memory-monitoring and self-regulation, meta-reasoning,consciousness/awarenessandautonoetic consciousness/self-awareness. In practice these capacities are used to regulate one's own cognition, to maximize one's potential to think,learnand to the evaluation of properethical/moral rules. It can also lead to a reduction in response time for a given situation as a result of heightened awareness, and potentially reduce the time to complete problems or tasks.

In the context of student metacognition, D. N. Perkins andGavriel Salomonobserve that metacognition concerns students' ability to monitor their progress. During this process, students ask questions like “What am I doing now?”, “Is it getting me anywhere?", and “What else could I be doing instead?”. Perkins and Salomon argue that such metacognitive practices help students to avoid unproductive approaches.[15]

### Psicología Educativa
Educational psychologyis the branch ofpsychologyconcerned with the scientific study of humanlearning. The study of learning processes, from bothcognitiveandbehavioralperspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences inintelligence,cognitivedevelopment,affect,motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role inlearning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design,classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.[1]

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily bypsychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship betweenmedicineandbiology. It is also informed byneuroscience. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, includinginstructional design,educational technology,curriculum development,organizational learning,special education,classroom management, and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes tocognitive scienceand thelearning theory. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.[2]

The field of educational psychology involves the study ofmemory, conceptual processes, and individual differences (via cognitive psychology) in conceptualizing new strategies for learning processes in humans. Educational psychology has been built upon theories ofoperant conditioning,functionalism,structuralism,constructivism,humanistic psychology,Gestalt psychology, andinformation processing.[1]

Educational psychology has seen rapid growth and development as a profession in the last twenty years.[3]School psychologybegan with the concept of intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum in the early part of the 20th century.[3]Another main focus of school psychology was to help close the gap for children of colour, as the fight against racial inequality and segregation was still very prominent, during the early to mid-1900s. However, "school psychology" itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in an attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.[3]

As a field of study, educational psychology is fairly new and was not considered a specific practice until the 20th century. Reflections on everyday teaching and learning allowed some individuals throughout history to elaborate on developmental differences in cognition, the nature of instruction, and the transfer of knowledge and learning. These topics are important to education and, as a result, they are important in understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.[4]

Some of the ideas and issues pertaining to educational psychology date back to the time ofPlatoandAristotle.Philosophersas well assophistsdiscussed the purpose ofeducation, training of the body and the cultivation of psycho-motor skills, the formation of good character, the possibilities and limits of moraleducation. Some other educational topics they spoke about were the effects of music, poetry, and the other arts on the development of the individual, role of the teacher, and the relations between teacher and student.[4]Plato saw knowledge acquisition as an innate ability, which evolves through experience and understanding of the world. This conception of human cognition has evolved into a continuing argument ofnature vs. nurturein understanding conditioning and learning today.Aristotle, on the other hand, ascribed to the idea of knowledge by association orschema. His fourlaws of associationincluded succession, contiguity, similarity, and contrast. His studies examined recall and facilitated learning processes.[5]

John Lockeis considered one of the most influential philosophers in post-renaissance Europe, a time period that began around the mid-1600s. Locke is considered the "Father of English Psychology". One of Locke's most important works was written in 1690, namedAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding. In this essay, he introduced the term "tabula rasa" meaning "blank slate." Locke explained that learning was attained through experience only and that we are all born without knowledge.[6]

## Recursos Educativos en Ecuador

### Educación Superior en Ecuador

- Ecuador has adeveloping economythat is highly dependent on commodities, namely petroleum and agricultural products. The country is classified as an upper-middle-income country. Ecuador's economy is the eighth largest in Latin America and experienced an average growth of 4.6% between 2000 and 2006.[139][failed verification]From 2007 to 2012, Ecuador's GDP grew at an annual average of 4.3 percent, above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean, which was 3.5%, according to the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean (ECLAC).[140]Ecuador was able to maintain relatively superior growth during the2008 financial crisis. In January 2009, the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) put the 2010 growth forecast at 6.88%.[141]In 2011, its GDP grew at 8% and ranked third highest in Latin America, behind Argentina (2nd) and Panama (1st).[142]Between 1999 and 2007, GDP doubled, reaching $65,490 million according to BCE.[143]The inflation rate until January 2008, was about 1.14%, the highest in the past year, according to the government.[144][145]The monthly unemployment rate remained at about 6 and 8 percent from December 2007 until September 2008; however, it went up to about 9 percent in October and dropped again in November 2008 to 8 percent.[146]Unemployment mean annual rate for 2009 in Ecuador was 8.5% because the global economic crisis continued to affect the Latin American economies. From this point, unemployment rates started a downward trend: 7.6% in 2010, 6.0% in 2011, and 4.8% in 2012.[147]

- The extreme poverty rate declined significantly between 1999 and 2010.[148]In 2001, it was estimated at 40% of the population, while by 2011 the figure dropped to 17.4% of the total population.[149]This is explained to an extent by emigration and the economic stability achieved after adopting the U.S. dollar as official means of transaction (before 2000, the Ecuadoriansucrewas prone to rampant inflation). However, starting in 2008, with the bad economic performance of the nations where most Ecuadorian emigrants work, the reduction of poverty has been realized through social spending, mainly in education and health.[150]

- The Ecuadorian Constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a "basic level of education", which is estimated at nine school years.[217]In 1996, the net primary enrollment rate was 96.9%, and 71.8% of children stayed in school until the fifth grade/age 10.[217]The cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government, but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs.[217]

### Programas de Financiamiento y Becas en Ecuador

- Student financial aid(orstudent financial support, orstudent aid) is financial support given to individuals who are furthering theireducation. Student financial aid can come in a number of forms, includingscholarships,grants,student loans, andwork studyprograms. Each of these methods of providing financial support to students has its advantages and drawbacks.

- Many countries have some kind of financial aid program for their students.[1]In countries that provide education to all at nominal cost, financial aid may have only a tertiary link to educational status, instead tied to the economic conditions of the family, and financial support for students is primarily indirect. InBelgium, for example, "[t]here is no system of student loans anddirectsupport is only given in the form of means-tested grants to students from low-income families", which constitutes a very limited proportion of students.[2]
